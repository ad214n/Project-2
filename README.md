##Overview
This is a full-stack application that allows a user to create a profile and input their exercises for the other members to view. This application also contains a page where users are able to input the gym facility they attend. In the future I would like to be able to link the user with the gym so that they are able to see which other users attend the same facility. I would also like to add an actual login for security purposes.
